# Pharmacy-Project

## The Martin’s Pharmacy

***What is this***? It will be a website that will have a look base on the Amazon Pharmacy website but will be focus more in helping the customer to get more information about their medication and Side Effect that can be cause by certain medication, also will provide a brief explanation in how this medication works in their bodies and lastly some links to website where they can get a coupon for free.

**Objective** → Right now the big goals is learn about pharmacy meds. and sharps my abilities as a web developer, but in the future I can publish this website so it can helps the user to expand their knowledge. 

**Estimate Time** → For now I want to make at least 3-5 meds and build the structure of the page after I’m done with that I will focus on style the Website and lastly I will do it interactive.
This will take me 1 month.
